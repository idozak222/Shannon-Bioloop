# 🔁 6. Shannon BioLoop
*Voice: environmental innovator — pragmatic, startup-savvy*

A challenge brief to prototype a **circular bio-economy atlas** for the Shannon Basin.

---

## Background
The Shannon Basin’s agri-industrial ecosystem produces abundant organic by-products—dairy residues, crop waste, timber offcuts, and municipal organics. Under **Ireland’s Circular Economy Strategy**, these can become new revenue streams through **local bio-loops**. Regions constantly produce under-used by-products (food waste, crop residues, textiles, demolition timber, heat, CO₂ streams). The actors who could turn these into value—processors, logistics providers, and end-users—are rarely visible to one another in space, time, and specification. As a result, feasible circular-economy pilots (biogas co-ops, fibre crops for insulation, reuse hubs, compost exchanges, heat-to-greenhouse loops, etc.) don’t get off the ground.

## Problem
Design an open, living geospatial map of resource loops that connects waste/by-product producers with processors and end-users, surfaces actionable pilot opportunities, and helps coalitions move from idea → feasibility → implementation.
**Key questions**
- What feedstocks exist, where, and at what volumes/seasonality?
- Which processors and off-takers are viable within realistic logistics radii?
- Which loops pencil out on unit economics and regulatory feasibility?
- How might siting and landscaping increase biodiversity (pollinator corridors, hedgerows, agroforestry buffers) around proposed hubs?
- Could local biomaterials (hemp, flax, seaweed, agri-residues) replace virgin inputs in insulation, panels, or packaging — and what properties would they need?
- Which resilience features (rainwater harvesting, drought/heat buffers, seed banks, diverse crops) prepare the system for shocks?

  **Coming up with critical quesitons is almost always an element of a winning idea**

## Possible Outcomes
1. **Shannon BioLoop Atlas**  
   - Public, browsable map (web) + source data (CSV/GeoJSON)  
   - Layers: feedstocks, processors, logistics corridors, demand nodes

2. **Loop Micro-Economics Sheets**  
   - CAPEX/OPEX, yields, transport assumptions, sensitivity ranges

3. **Regulatory Checklists**  
   - Permits, compliance steps, standards, and relevant authorities
   - ## Inspiration
**Kalundborg Symbiosis (Denmark)** shows that waste-as-resource ecosystems can sustain rural economies while cutting emissions.---
**Kamikatsu, Japan** — a small mountain town sustains local reuse/repair businesses via a Zero-Waste Center and resident sorting (>80% recycling), turning “waste” into community value. 
￼
**Nesselnbach, Switzerland** — food-waste biogas is upgraded to biomethane and the off-gas CO₂ is purified/liquefied and sold as a product, adding rural revenue streams and closing loops.  ￼
   
> The Atlas serves as a **teaching aid**, **research reference**, **investment teaser**, and a **prototype** for circular-enterprise hubs.

## Difficulty
**Intermediate** — data synthesis + stakeholder mapping. Can be elevated with unqiue engineering solutions and scientific manipulation

## Scope

Scope (prompts, not instructions)
	•	Spot what matters locally: What leftover materials exist nearby, where do they show up, and who touches them? If you sanity-checked quantities, what simple observations (e.g., “how full is a typical bin on a typical day?”) might help?
	•	Use plain-sense science & engineering to reason: How could you sketch a “what goes in ≈ what comes out” check for a candidate loop? Where might a hub make sense so most suppliers/users are “not too far”? If you imagined delivery rounds, what patterns would keep trucks from backtracking? What quick way could you compare the total footprint of two options (e.g., compost vs. biogas)?
	•	Test thinking with small experiments (on paper or in code): What’s the tiniest trial—or simple computer mock-up—that would reveal whether timing, quality, or cost will break the idea? Which few numbers would you track to learn fastest, and how would you compare options when those numbers are uncertain?
	•	Invite others and shape the rules together: Who should be in the conversation (makers, movers, users, neighbours), and what light-touch norms for sharing info would build trust? What simple “opportunity card” could others quickly react to, and what would success look like to them?
